## Overview

The automotive industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation driven by three key forces: digitalization, electrification, and smart transportation systems.

## Three Key Drivers

### 1. Digitalization Through Autonomous Driving

The shift toward software-defined vehicles and autonomous driving capabilities represents a fundamental change in how vehicles are designed, manufactured, and operated.

### 2. Electric Mobility

Zero-carbon emission goals are accelerating the transition from internal combustion engines to electric powertrains.

### 3. Smart Transportation Systems

Intelligent infrastructure and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication are reshaping urban mobility.

## Technology Classification

### Cutting-Edge Technology

Fully developed technical features ready for deployment:
- Vehicle connectivity
- Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)
- Infotainment systems
- Over-the-air (OTA) updates

### Bleeding-Edge Technology

Emerging technologies with reliability challenges:
- Fully autonomous vehicles (Level 4-5)
- Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication
- Inter-vehicle coordination systems

## Three Technology Pillars

### 1. Artificial Intelligence

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Inference | Decision making from sensor data |
| Recognition | Object and scene understanding |
| Planning | Path and behavior planning |

### 2. Big Data Analytics

The 3Vs of automotive data:

$$
\text{Value} = f(\text{Volume}, \text{Variety}, \text{Velocity})
$$

- **Volume**: Terabytes of sensor data per vehicle per day
- **Variety**: Camera, LiDAR, radar, GPS, CAN bus data
- **Velocity**: Real-time processing requirements

### 3. Internet of Everything (IoE)

Connected ecosystem including:
- Vehicles
- Infrastructure
- Pedestrians
- Cloud services

## Innovation Types

### Evolutionary Innovation

Gradual technological progress:
- Incremental improvements to existing systems
- Optimization of current architectures
- Continuous feature enhancement

### Revolutionary Innovation

Disruptive mobility solutions:
- New vehicle architectures
- Novel business models (MaaS)
- Paradigm shifts in transportation

## Stakeholder Analysis
