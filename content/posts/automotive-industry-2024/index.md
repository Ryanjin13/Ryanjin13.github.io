## 2024 Industry Keywords

### 1. Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV)

SDV represents a paradigm shift where vehicle functionality is primarily determined by software rather than hardware.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Centralized computing architecture
- Over-the-air (OTA) updates
- Feature-on-demand services
- Continuous improvement post-sale

**Development Status:**
- Beginning of formal research and consensus
- AI acceleration potentially affecting standards timeline
- Cross-industry collaboration emerging

**SDV Architecture:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│       Cloud Services            │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│    Vehicle Software Platform    │
├──────────┬──────────┬───────────┤
│  ADAS    │  Body    │  Powertrain│
│  Domain  │  Domain  │  Domain    │
├──────────┴──────────┴───────────┤
│      Hardware Abstraction       │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│      Physical Components        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Hybrid Vehicles

Hybrid powertrains are experiencing renewed momentum as pure EV adoption faces challenges.

**Driving Factors:**
- Range anxiety concerns
- Charging infrastructure gaps
- Battery cost fluctuations
- Consumer hesitancy

**Hybrid Types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Mild Hybrid (MHEV) | 48V system, start-stop, regeneration |
| Full Hybrid (HEV) | Electric-only capability at low speeds |
| Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) | External charging, extended EV range |

**Benefits:**

$$
\text{Hybrid Efficiency} = \frac{\text{ICE Efficiency} + \text{EV Efficiency}}{2} \times \text{Synergy Factor}
$$

The synergy factor accounts for regenerative braking and optimal engine operation.

## Technology Convergence

### SDV + Electrification

```
